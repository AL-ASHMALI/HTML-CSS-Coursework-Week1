       <div class="ali-article-content">
       <p>Mohammed Ali, (born January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.â€”died June 3, 2016, Scottsdale, Arizona), American professional boxer and social activist.
       Ali was the first fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on
       three separate occasions; he successfully defended this title 19 times.<br>
       ALi, grew up in the American South in a time of segregated public facilities. His father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr.,
       supported a wife and two sons by painting billboards and signs. His mother, Odessa Grady Clay, worked as a household
       domestic.<br> 
       He was brought up in Louisville, Kentucky, and from a young age, it became evident that he was something special. His
       speed and reactions were such that he often challenged his younger brother, Rudy, to throw rocks at him, all of which he
       dodged.<br> 
       In October 1954, Mohammed had his bike stolen. The 12-year-old found a police officer, Joe Martin, who decided to re-direct
       Clay's anger at losing his bike, and desire to gain retribution, into the boxing ring.<br>
       Martin trained young boxers at a local gym and invited Mohammed to come along. It wasn't long before Mohammed was in the ring,
       and he was immediately found winning ways, beating his first ever opponent, Ronnie O'Keefe, by a split decision.<br>
       In 1956, Mohammed ALi was becoming a very effective light-heavyweight. He won the novice Golden Gloves Championship
       in that year. In 1959, after more years of climbing up the ranks, Ali won the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champion, and
       the National AAU light-heavyweight championship.<br>      
       Ali was becoming a major name in amateur boxing. In 1960, he was confirmed as part of the USA team for the Olympics.
       Still fighting at light-heavyweight, Ali only just got to Rome.<br>      
       His fear of flying almost prevented him going to the Olympics, but he was eventually persuaded. He still wasn't 100
       percent sure, however, and actually brought a parachute onto the plane with him.<br>      
       It proved to be well worth it. He won gold in Rome, beating Polish fighter Zbigniew Pietrzkowski in the final. His
       personality was beginning to get noticed as well. His dominant persona and confidence earned him the nickname "The Mayor
       of the Olympic Village," despite being 18-years old.<br>
       Ali was beginning to get noticed because of his fighting style, which relied on a quick feet and punches and great defense. 
       He was known for making predictions about how he would win the fight against his opponent. He was rarely wrong.<br> 
       He continued to fight in the ring, and continued to win, beating Americans, British, and Germans along the way. His
       fight against Cleveland Williams in 1966 has been described as Ali's greatest performance.<br>
       In his illustrious career, Ali was named Fighter of the Year by Ring Magazine more than any other fighter, and was
       involved in more Ring Magazine Fight of the Year than anyone else.<br>      
       He has been named as the Sportsman of the Century by both Sports Illustrated and the BBC.<br>      
       His overall career stats are 61 fights, 56 wins (37 by KO), and five losses.<br>      
       A true great of boxing, and of sport, this has been a tribute to Muhammad Ali.<br>To read more about Mohammed Ali you can visit <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/64615-a-tribute-tomuhammad-ali" target="blank"> bleacherreport</a>
